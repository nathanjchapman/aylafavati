    				<h4>I am a user experience researcher passionate about music and sound technology.</h4>
                </header>
                <section>
    				<p>As a graduate student at New York University I have rediscovered an excitement for research alongside a fascination with sound technology. While I finish my multidisciplinary thesis related to immersive audio, psychoacoustics, and music cognition, I am digging into user experience research and mastering music. </p>
    				<p>I practice curiosity and courage. I enjoy getting to know people and understanding how they think. I am a strong communicator and translator, using my strengths to synthesize research into meaningful insights. I strive to enact positive change through collaborative action and open, honest communication. </p>
    				<p>I consider myself a lifelong learner. I study and put together nourishing and beautiful dishes (Ligurian Focaccia is favorite recipe of mine- thank you, <a href="https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/fat/ligurian-focaccia">Samin Nosrat</a>.) I hike and rock climb and travel and read as many books as my brain can absorb. I lose track of time when I’m deep in conversation with a friend over a good cup of tea.</p>
    				<p>My surname, Favati, is rooted in the history of the Fava bean. Fava &gt; Favati. The Fava plant inspired the design of my website as a small tribute to those family members of immeasurable importance in my life. Thank you.</p>
