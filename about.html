				    <h2>About</h2>
    				<h4>I am a UX Researcher and Mastering Engineer.</h4>

    				<p>A professor of mine recently referenced a masterclass led by Joyce DiDonato, a prolific operatic soprano. In the video, Joyce explains the importance of developing and trusting the process of singing, rather than focusing on the destination or result. I am a vocalist, so of course I saved and revisited this video. I recall it now because both UX Research and Mastering Engineering require the same development and trust of one's process. This is one reason why I enjoy these disciplines. Results and discoveries are compelling and beautiful, but they are only attainable through the careful consideration and implementation of process.</p>
    				<p>By presenting her masterclass Joyce alludes to another important ingredient in the development of a successful process: collaboration with a team of other skilled professionals. In voice, a teacher and coach are necessary to develop a healthy and effective process. In UX Research, differing voices are required to minimize unconscious bias thereby creating more comprehensive research and inclusive design. In Mastering, an Artist, Mix Engineer, and/or Producer are needed to understand the scope of a project and meaning behind creative choices. Collaboration and open, honest communication are essential to developing the kind of process I strive for.</p>
    				<p>In my personal life, I consider myself a lifelong learner. I study and put together nourishing and beautiful dishes (Ligurian Focaccia is favorite recipe of mine- thank you, <a href="https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/fat/ligurian-focaccia">Samin Nosrat</a>.) I hike and rock climb and travel and read as many books as my brain can absorb. I lose track of time when I’m deep in conversation with a friend over a good cup of tea.</p>
    				<p>My surname, Favati, is rooted in the history of the Fava bean. Fava &gt; Favati. The Fava plant inspired the design of my website as a small tribute to those family members of immeasurable importance in my life. Thank you.</p>
